## Deploy Orka Server
A collection of python and ansible scripts to facilitate the deployment of a specific version of the application for serving the orka portal.  
The environment consists of a standalone Virtual Machine running a release configuration with the Nginx-uWSGI-Postgres stack, serving the application from a public IP.
Information on deploy, start, update the orka portal are found in the e-science/orka/README.md file. Instead of checking out the master branch, you should check out the orka_portal one.
